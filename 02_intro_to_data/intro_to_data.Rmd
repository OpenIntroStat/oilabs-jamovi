Some define statistics as the field that focuses on turning information into knowledge.
The first step in that process is to summarize and describe the raw information -- the data.
In this lab we explore flights, specifically a random sample of domestic flights that departed from the three major New York City airports in 2013.
We will generate simple graphical and numerical summaries of data on these flights and explore delay times.
Since this is a large data set, along the way you'll also learn the indispensable skills of data processing and subsetting.

## Getting started

### The data

The [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/about/) (BTS) is a statistical agency that is a part of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA).
As its name implies, BTS collects and makes transportation data available, such as the flights data we will be working with in this lab.

First, we'll load the the `nycflights` dataset. Download the data [here](./more/nycflights.csv), and load it into Jamovi.

The data set `nycflights` that shows up in your workspace is a *data matrix*, with each row representing an *observation* and each column representing a *variable*.

We will refer to this data format a **data frame**, which is a term that will be used throughout the labs.
For this data set, each *observation* is a single flight.

The **codebook** (description of the variables) can be accessed by loading [this page](https://www.openintro.org/book/statdata/index.php?data=nycflights).

One of the variables refers to the carrier (i.e. airline) of the flight, which is coded according to the following system.

-   `carrier`: Two letter carrier abbreviation.

    -   `9E`: Endeavor Air Inc.
    -   `AA`: American Airlines Inc.
    -   `AS`: Alaska Airlines Inc.
    -   `B6`: JetBlue Airways
    -   `DL`: Delta Air Lines Inc.
    -   `EV`: ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
    -   `F9`: Frontier Airlines Inc.
    -   `FL`: AirTran Airways Corporation
    -   `HA`: Hawaiian Airlines Inc.
    -   `MQ`: Envoy Air
    -   `OO`: SkyWest Airlines Inc.
    -   `UA`: United Air Lines Inc.
    -   `US`: US Airways Inc.
    -   `VX`: Virgin America
    -   `WN`: Southwest Airlines Co.
    -   `YV`: Mesa Airlines Inc.

The `nycflights` data frame is a massive trove of information.
Let's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:

-   How delayed were flights that were headed to Los Angeles?
-   How do departure delays vary by month?
-   Which of the three major NYC airports has the best on time percentage for departing flights?

## Analysis

### Departure delays

Let's start by examining the distribution of departure delays of all flights with a histogram. Select `Exploration`, then `Description`, then move the variable `dep_delay` to the `Variables` box. Click `Plots`, then check the `Histograms` box.

Histograms are generally a very good way to see the shape of a single distribution of numerical data, but that shape can change depending on how the data is split between the different bins. Jamovi attempts to choose a reasonable number of bins. (They are working to allow the user to change the number of bins, though this feature is not available yet.)

If you want to visualize only on delays of flights headed to Los Angeles, you need to first `filter` the data for flights with that destination. To do this, click the data tab at the top of the window, where you will see an icon that looks like a funnel in the top bar. This brings up the filter menu, where we can apply conditions.


We want to only use arrivals where the destination is Los Angeles, so our condition is `dest=="LAX"`. The two equal signs is a "test" which determines whether the variable `dest` is equal to the value "LAX", and anything other than that condition will be filtered out. You will then see parts of your data greyed out, leaving only the requested data. 

Go back to the Analysis tab to create a new histogram of `dep_delay` and you will see that your histogram only uses the flights where the destination is Los Angeles.

You can also obtain numerical summaries for these flights in the `Descriptives` table, created by default when you select the `dep_delay` variable in the `Descriptives` menu.

You can also filter based on multiple criteria. Suppose you are interested in flights headed to San Francisco (SFO) in February. Bring up the filter menu. We want the use only data that satisfies the conditions `dest=="SFO` and `month==2`, which we can do by using a filter `dest=="SFO" and month==2`.


<!-- Similarly to the last filter, we will enter `dest=SFO`. If you apply this filter and look at the very bottom of the JASP window, you will see that of the original 32,735 flights, we are now only considering 1,345 of them. To add the next condition, we click `month`, which starts a second line in our filter menu, then finish the line to make `month=2`. This leaves us with 68 flights. -->

You can create more complicated filters as well. If you are interested in either flights headed to SFO **or** in February, you can use the "or" operator. A formula of `dest=="SFO" or month==2` will give this.

1.  Filter the data to include only flights headed to LAX in March. How many flights meet these criteria?
    **Hint:** You can do this by subtracting the values in "Row count" and "Filtered" at the bottom of the window, or by making a descriptives summary table and finding the count (N).

2.  Describe the distribution of the **arrival** delays of these flights using a histogram and appropriate summary statistics.
    **Hint:** The summary statistics you use should depend on the shape of the distribution.

Another useful technique is quickly calculating summary statistics for various groups in your data frame. We'll go back to including all of our data, so you can either delete the filter or click the active switch on the created filter to make it inactive.

Go back to the `Descriptives` menu. To get the summary stats departure delays for each origin airport, we can use `dep_delay` as our variable, and put `origin` in the `Split by` box.

Note that we could also add a histogram here, and Jamovi will create a histogram for each origin airport.




1.  Click the `Statistics` menu above the `Plots` menu within `Descriptives`. Check the `IQR` option in Dispersion to add these values to our table. Which carrier has the most variable arrival delays?

### Departure delays by month

Which month would you expect to have the highest average delay departing from an NYC airport?

Let's think about how you could answer this question. You could get descriptive statistics for the departure delays using `month` as your split variable.

<!-- , and illustrate the importance of types of variables.  If you try to do this, you will see that JASP will not accept month in the `Split` box. This is because `Split` only allows ordinal and nominal variables. Go back to your data, click the name of the `month` variable to switch it to ordinal, then create your summary table of departure delays by month. -->

1.  Suppose you really dislike departure delays and you want to schedule your travel in a month that minimizes your potential departure delay leaving NYC. One option is to choose the month with the lowest mean departure delay. Another option is to choose the month with the lowest median departure delay. What are the pros and cons of these two choices?

```{=html}
<!--
Which month has the highest average departure delay from an NYC airport? What
    about the highest median departure delay? Which of these measures is more 
    reliable for deciding which month(s) to avoid flying if you really dislike 
    delayed flights.
-->
```


### On time departure rate for NYC airports

Suppose you will be flying out of NYC and want to know which of the three major NYC airports has the best on time departure rate of departing flights. Also supposed that for you, a flight that is delayed for less than 5 minutes is basically "on time." You consider any flight delayed for 5 minutes of more to be "delayed".

In order to determine which airport has the best on time departure rate, you can first classify each flight as "on time" or "delayed", then calculate the percentage of flights that are on time for each origin airport.

To do this, we are going to take advantage of a clever idea. While we could label flights being on time with a true or false, we are going to use 1's and 0's. If you use 1's and 0's, the mean of the column of 1's and 0's will be the same as the percentage of the rows that are 1's.

We'll begin by making a new variable. Label this variable `dep_type`, and in the formula for the variable, use `dep_delay<5` to identify flights where the delay is less than 5 minutes. Open the `Descriptives`, and create a table using the newly created variable `dep_type` and split by `origin`. Inspect the means in the table, which represent the percentage of rows that are `true`.

1.  If you were selecting an airport simply based on on time departure percentage, which NYC airport would you choose to fly out of?

<!-- NOT IN JASP: You can also visualize the distribution of on on time departure rate across the three airports using a segmented bar plot. -->

<!-- ```{r viz-origin-dep-type} -->
<!-- ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = origin, fill = dep_type)) + -->
<!--   geom_bar() -->
<!-- ``` -->

## More Practice

1.  Create a new variable that contains the average speed, `avg_speed` traveled by the plane for each flight (in mph).
    **Hint:** Average speed can be calculated as distance divided by number of hours of travel, and note that `air_time` is given in minutes.

2.  Make a scatterplot of `avg_speed` vs. `distance`.
    Describe the relationship between average speed and distance.
    <!-- **Hint:** Use `geom_point()`. -->

3.  Replicate the following plot. 
    **Hint:** The data frame plotted only contains flights from American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines. You can create a filter, and use "or" to select only flights that are from those airlines (you can string together multiple "or"s).
    Once you replicate the plot, determine (roughly) what the cutoff point is for departure delays where you can still expect to get to your destination on time.

<!--
```{r plot-to-replicate, echo=FALSE, fig.show="asis", fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
dl_aa_ua <- nycflights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL" | carrier == "UA")
ggplot(data = dl_aa_ua, aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay, color = carrier)) +
  geom_point()
```
-->
